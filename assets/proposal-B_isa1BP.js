It will be an inventory system based on RFID and NFC that tracks items and the person who took them. RFID would be used to find what is still in the inventory and report it to the database for manipulation and display. NFC would be used to track who took what. On the top level to use this system, the crew member would scan a designated NFC tag (smartwatches would work) to access the supplies. When the NFC tag is scanned the crewmember will be logged and the system will take an initial check of what is currently in inventory. The crewmember will then be able to take the supplies they need. When the crewmember closes access to the supplies, there will be a final check of what is currently in inventory. The final supplies count will be updated on the database and using the difference between the initial and final we'll see what was taken and will be put in a database along with the crewmember that scanned their NFC tag. The database would be available in a sortable crewmember-specific web interface where each crewmember can see their supplies and what they have taken.

Supabase gives us the scalability of firebase while still offering the option of self hosting on a device like a raspberry pi. Node.js has extensive documentation on RFID scanners and integrates with Vue quite nicely. This also makes the only language proficiencies needed for adding functionality being javascript.
